# Yolov3 Object Detection with Flask and Tensorflow 2.0 (APIs and Detections)
Yolov3 is an algorithm that uses deep convolutional neural networks to perform object detection. This repository implements Yolov3 using TensorFlow 2.0 and creates two easy-to-use APIs that you can integrate into web or mobile applications. <br>

The web application was deployed to heroku through github. However due to the size of the detection model file(234MB) heroku fails to run the app.
The error below is returned in the logs.
